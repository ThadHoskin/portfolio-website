# Purpose

When designing this website. my main purpose was to attract people to use my set of skills to help them design their very own website. Another purpose of the website was to showcase the skills that i had learnt during the past 5 weeks at coder academy. 

# Functionality/features

The functionality and UX is a minimalist journey. I myself like minimal websites, the less the better. Functionality being key. I dont want to over stress the eyes. i like black and white websites, with natural colors like lights blues, and grays. The idea behind this is to present strength and power with black and white, as well as a calming effect with using teh neutral colors that i have matched with the black and white. The minimal features i used were, some bolding with the hover tag, as well as some color changes with the hover. The navigation bar easily takes you through the site, being able to return to any page from the page you are on, except for the contact section which is directly below the main page. The 'about' and 'blog' pages are then directed from the main nav.
