          <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <h3 id="h3-font-weight">WHAT I'M UPTO</h3>          
            <p>Currently I am in the process of completing a Coding bootcamp at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a> and thoroughly enjoying it. Meeting some very cool, like-minded people, and learning the art of coding and web design ! Finishing up in August !</p>

            <p>I have been working with HTML5 and CSS , making static websites, look forward to working with new clients building them the best site we can design together for them. I have experience in Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I look forward to hearing form you, to make the best site we can together. Please feel free to check out <a href="resume.pdf">my CV.</a></p>
            
            <p>Prior to joining Coder Academy i was working in construction as a concrete finisher, so i know the meaning of a hard days work! Even before that i was living London fr 2 years. At university i completed a dipGrad in Music Performance, hoping i can also transfer my creative side to helping you design a killer website.</p>

          <h3 id="h3-font-weight">WHAT I LIKE TO DO</h3>
          <p>At the moment , i have recently started running again, trying to get back to some good pace. Am just starting out slow and making sure i don't reaggravate an old achilles injury , ü§û its stays that way.  </p>

          <p>You may have also seen me skateboarding around the streets of Northcote, using my skateboard regularly to fetch my groceries or , at them momment get out the the house. If you see me, feel free to giv me a 'toot' </p>

          <p>I also like to eat healthy, everyone has their description of healthy eating, but mine is little sugar (to avoid those 3pm crashes! ) lots of vegetables and fruit, and heaps of macadamia nuts. Im vegetarian so no meat for me!</p>

          <p id="last-p-spacing">And lastly, what consumes my time (other than coding of course, is basketball. I love basketball ! I either play (real and fantasy league) or watch basketball ball, multiple time a day. If you're ever keen on some shots, let me know ! </p>
